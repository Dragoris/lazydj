# lazydj

LazyDj is a simple music player that uses the Soundcloud API to allow users to search and control songs as well as enjoy some cycling images as their songs play.

This "app" represents my introduction to programming and the first project I worked on. Shout out @bluecadmium for stumbling through the process with me.
